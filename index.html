    <h1>How will you perform under pressure?</h1>

        <!-- Rules of the game -->
        <p>Welcome to a timed test of your knowledge! In the following moments you will be 
           presented with a set of 10 coding questions. As soon as you click the start button
           below, your time of 5 minutes will begin. Each correctly answered question will earn
           you 10 points, however, each incorrect answer will reduce your time by 10 seconds. 
           When time runs out or you answer all of the questions that's game over and you will
           attach your initials to your score. Good luck!
        </p>

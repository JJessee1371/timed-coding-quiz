# timed-coding-quiz

The main goal of this project was to place a heavy emphasis on DOM manipulation
and dynamic changing of HTML and CSS through use of vanilla JavaScript. This was
an opportunity to bring all 3 languages together to build a responsive site that
also serves as an opportunity to test the users knowledge on basic JavaScript
concepts.
